React Native Forms:
No direct equivalent to the HTML <form> element

In React, you still had to use components (such as Form and LocalForm) that would render to the HTML <form> elements in the browser DOM - this is not necessary in React Native.

You will still use components that act similarly to HTML elements that take input from the user:

Choose Yes/No, True/False, On/Off etc:
HTML: Radio Buttons - React Native: Switch component.

Choose multiple options:
HTML: <option> and <select> - React Native: Picker and Picker.Item

Enter Text:
HTML: <input> - React Native: TextInput

Expo SDK

Expo SDK provides access to device and system functionality such as contacts, camera, and GPS location.

Expo's Limitations:
Not all iOS and Androids APIs are available yet.

The SDK does not support all types of background code execution.

If you need to keep your app size extremely lean, the managed workflow may not be the best choice.

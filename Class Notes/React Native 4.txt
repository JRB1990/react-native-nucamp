Multiple types of storage available for mobile device: localStorage, AsyncStorage, Expo Secure Store, and more.

Unencrypted key-value storage: React Native Async Storage API.

Expo Secure Store API: encrypted key-value storage
- meant to be used for small amounts of sensitive data.
- uses iOS keychain services and Android SharedPreferences/Keystore system.

The Expo Secure Store API exposes 3 methods:

SecureStore.setItemAsync(key, value, options) - returns a promise that will reject if value cannot be stored on the device

SecureStore.getItemAsync(key, options) - returns a promise that will resolve to stored value, or resolve to null if no entry for given key, or reject if error occured

SecureStore.deleteItemAsync(key, options) - returns a promise that will reject if the value could not be deleted

Notifications are a common way of drawing attention by adding an icon to the notification bar and a message to the notification drawer.

Local Notifications are generated from the client side;
Push Notifications are generated from the server side;
(but still use the same mechanism to display the notification on the client side)

The Expo Notifications API provides access to both push (remote) notifications and local notifications.

Local Notifications can be sent immediately, or at a scheduled time, either once or on a recurring basis.

Example use case:
An application that sends a notification to a user at a specific, reccuring time, such as a reminder to exercise every morning.

Or a calendar-based app that sends an event reminder, or a notification about something happening in the app.

Expo Notifications API:
Notifications.presentLocalNotificationAsync(localNotification) - trigger a local notification immediately.

Notifications.scheduleLocalNotificationAsync(localNotification, schedulingOptions) - schedule a local notification to fire at some specific time in the future or at a given interval.

Notification.dismissNotificationAsync(localNotificationId) - dismisses the notification with the given id (Android only)

There are several other methods available from the Notifications API, for generating push notifications, canceling a scheduled notification, etc.

The localNotification object has two required string properties: title and body.
Four optional properties: data, categoryId, iOS, Android.

We will need to request permission to generate notifications from the underlying operating system using the Expo Permissions API.

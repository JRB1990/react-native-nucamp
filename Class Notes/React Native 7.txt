Mobile devices today are typically equipped with a camera, as well as an image gallery app for images saved to the device.

The camera can be used for more than taking photos, ex. scanning a barcode or QR code.

Expo SDK offers several APIs to access the camera as well as access and manipulate saved images.

Expo imagepicker API:
Provides access to system UI to select image/video from the device's library, or take a new photo or video as your selection.

ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync(options)

ImagePicker.launchCameraAsync(options)

The launchCameraAsync method will return a promise.
This promise is fulfilled when the user either takes a photo and confirms the choice, or cancels the photo taking operation.

Resolved promise: If a photo was taken, returns object with media uri, width and height, media type, and more.

If no photo was taken because the operation was cancelled, the resolve object will only have one property, a cancelled property set to true -- can check for this and respond appropriately.

Expo ImageManipulator API:
-use to alter an image
-apply transforms: resize, rotate, flip, or crop
-configure compression level, format (JPEG or PNG)
-whether to include image data in Base64 format

Expo Camera API:
-provides a React component that renders a preview for the device's front or back camera.
-you can adjust zoom, autofocus, white balance, flash mode
-you can take photo, or start and stop video recording
-detect faces, scan a barcode, and more

A mobile device will usually be conneccted to a network.

Sometimes, the mobile device will lose connectivity, or be taken offline, or switch from one network type to another, such as from WiFi to Cellular or vice versa.

It can be useful for a mobile app to know when a device's network connection changes, so it can deal with the network changes if necessary.

An app might support switching to offline operation, and possibly handle synchronizing changes with a remote server when the device reconnects to a network.

An app might also want access to information about a network connection for other reasons, such as pausing large data transfers if a device is not on WiFi.

React Native Community's NetInfo Library:
Originally a part of React Native, moved to a third party library maintained by the React native Community organization.

You will install it with a scoped install, ex:
yarn install @react-native-community/netinfo

This lets you know that this is an official package maintained by this organization.

NetInfo.fetch()
- gets current state of the network, returns a promise that resolves to a NetInfoState object

NetInfo.addEventListener(NetInfoState => {...})
- subscribe to network changes, automatically gives you access to the NetInfoState object, returns a function that will unsubscribe this listener
